# Welcome to my methods tutorials!
I plan to expand this to other tutorials soon, but for now, enjoy [this tutorial](https://praat-enthusiast.github.io/asr/jekyll/2024-09-12-tutorial.html) aimed at anyone hoping to use ASR to support transcription in sociolinguistic or phonetic research, and covers running ASR using WhisperX, converting it to other file formats, and correcting its output.
